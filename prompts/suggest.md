# Context-Aware Suggestions

Generate 2–4 DM-facing suggestions based on the current session state.

Each suggestion should be:

- Short
- Actionable
- Easy to improvise

Use: known NPC motivations, active conflicts, existing clues, session pacing.

Avoid: random disconnected ideas, major retcons, new lore that contradicts established facts.
